# Radar Segmentation Dataset (RadSeg)

RadSeg is a synthetic radar dataset designed for building semantic segmentation models for radar activity recognition. Unlike existing radio classification datasets that only provide signal-wise annotations for short and isolated IQ sequences, RadSeg provides sample-wise annotations for interleaved radar pulse activities that extend across a long time horizon. This makes RadSeg the first annotated public dataset of its kind for radar activity recognition. This dataset is released to the public under the MIT License.

## Dataset Details

RadSeg contains pulsed radar signals at varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) between -20 to 20 dB with a resolution of 0.5 dB. This repository provides the RadSeg dataset which consists of three parts:

- `RadSeg-Train` contains 60,000 radar signals for model training;
- `RadSeg-Valadation` contains 10,000 radar signals for model validation; and
- `RadSeg-Test` contains 10,000 radar signals held out for testing.

This dataset comprises a total of 5 radar signal types, which include: 
- Barker codes, up to a code length of 13;
- Polyphase Barker codes, up to a code length of 13;
- Frank codes, up to a code length of 16;
- Linear frequency-modulated (LFM) pulses; and 
- Coherent unmodulated pulse trains. 

Integer mapping of class labels are given below:

```python
# Number of signal classes
num_classes = 5

# Channel class indices, note the shape of a batch is therefore [batch_size, 6, sequence_len]
seg_classes = {
    "0": "noise", # Noise channel not used for training
    "1": "cpt",
    "2": "barker",
    "3": "polyphase",
    "4": "frank",
    "5": "lfm"
}
```

Additional dataset characteristics:
- The sampling rate used in RadSeg is 3.2 MHz. 
- Each radar signal contains 32,768 complex, baseband IQ samples. Note, we use a subdivision of the total available samples in our ICASSP paper as part of our data augmentation workflow.
- Annotations are provided as channel-wise binary masks where each channel corresponds to a signal type.

Please refer to our [conference paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445810) for additional details on RadSeg.

## RadSeg Dataloader

To easily work with RadSeg, please feel free to use or adapt the data module in `dataset.py`. Below is an example workflow for creating train, validation, and test dataloaders using PyTorch:

```python
# Root
DATA_PATH = {
    "TRAIN_DATA_PATH": "./RadSeg/train", # NOTE: Replace this as required
    "VAL_DATA_PATH": "./RadSeg/val", 
    "TEST_DATA_PATH": "./RadSeg/test"
}

# Configs
sampler=True, 
sample_window=int(4096), # Used in our ICASSP paper 
subdivision=2, # Augmentation used in our ICASSP paper
enable_mtl=False # NOTE: Not publicly available yet, but hopefully soon...

# Make train set
train_set = RadSegDataset(
    data_path=data_path["TRAIN_DATA_PATH"], 
    sampler=sampler, 
    sample_window=sample_window, 
    is_train=True,
    subdivision=subdivision,
    enable_mtl=enable_mtl
)

# Compute norm params using train set stats
train_norm_params = {
    "mu": train_set.signals_mu, # Mu is a complex number 
    "mu_real": np.real(train_set.signals_mu), 
    "mu_imag": np.imag(train_set.signals_mu),
    "var": train_set.signals_var
}

# Make validation set and test set
val_set, test_set = \
    RadSegDataset(
        data_path=data_path["VAL_DATA_PATH"], 
        sampler=sampler, 
        sample_window=sample_window, 
        is_train=False,
        normalisation_params=train_norm_params, 
        subdivision=subdivision,
        enable_mtl=enable_mtl
    ), \
    RadSegDataset(
        data_path=data_path["TEST_DATA_PATH"], 
        sampler=sampler, 
        sample_window=sample_window, 
        is_train=False,          
        normalisation_params=train_norm_params, 
        subdivision=subdivision,
        enable_mtl=enable_mtl
    )
```
